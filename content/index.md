:wave: Welcome to my website where I occasionally blog about projects I am attempting, usually involving coding in Python or Julia, Data Science/Analysis, Deep Learning, or anything else that I take an interest in!

You can find my [posts](/posts/), my [CV](/cv/cv.pdf), and some information [about me](/about/). You can also go on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickcalvert/) and my [GitHub](https://github.com/ncalvertuk).
