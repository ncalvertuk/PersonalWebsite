I created this blog as a platform to share my interests and projects that I am working on in my own time. My interests are Data Analysis and Machine Learning in Python and Julia. I occasionally blog about projects that I am undertaking and think are interesting. I hope you do too.  

My background has predominantly been in Mathematics and Physics with a focus on nuclear and x-ray imaging. I undertook a MMath in Mathematics at the University of Manchester between 2005-2009 where my dissertation examined image reconstruction for gamma-ray Computed Tomography (CT). Upon graduation I worked on image processing, research and development with a focus on transmission x-ray imaging systems for the security industry. 

I obtained my PhD from University College London in 2016 with a focus on Time-of-Flight (ToF) x-ray scatter imaging. I designed experiments, implemented data analysis algorithms (converting electronic detector signals into energy and timing information), performed Monte Carlo simulations, and devised a mathematical forward model of x-ray scattering. I solved the associated non-linear inverse problem using a number of algorithms (including Levenberg Marquardt and ADMM), testing out different regularisation functions.

After my PhD I worked on implementing the reconstruction algorithm for a novel walk-through metal detection system that was able to locate and discriminate between benign and threat objects. I then moved to the NHS working as a Senior Research Scientist for the Christie NHS Foundation trust. My focus was on Molecular Radiotherapy a treatment given to late-stage cancer patients. I optimised image reconstruction and partial volume correction algorithms for SPECT imaging, designed 3D printed test objects, and implemented different dosimetric techniques - modelling and fitting pharmacokinetic models derived from patient SPECT scans.
